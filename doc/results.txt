What types of "data products" do we want to compute automatically?

We want to be able to give a "snapshot" of all the results of a particular
expriment.  Comparisons between experiments are a higher level.

Every "data product" should have a revision number.

calibration data
    -- always imported into database
    -- plot of calibrations curves, includes equation

For stratification measurement, we should have a plot of stratification
     -- needs zmin / zmax to make this work
     -- needs calibration data (calib_id and equation...)
     -- need to estimate N2 or deltaRho, or ?? can I classify these in some way?
     -- plots should flag if data is not been QC'd

video clips
    -- needs world coordinate grid and a time measurement
    -- file format
    -- thumbnail summary
    -- raw video clip 
    -- video with frame number/time codes/video_id/date

    -- is there an interface to track?
    -- is there objects to track position and orientation?
    -- is there synthetic schlieren to process
        -- lines? dots?
        -- compute dz, dn2, dn2t
        -- spectrums -- fft? kx, kz, omega,
        -- plot of spectrums
    -- compute energy and energy flux

experiment -- web pages/PHP - report?
    experiment_id, experimenter, date/time
    stratification plot and "strat parameters"
    representative image of raw data
    representative image of processed data
    indication of "primary measurements"
    sketch of experiment setup
    measurements
    world grid
    forcing conditions (wave generator?)
    experiments give context to the data

projects
    collection of experiments
    comparisons between experiments
    representative experiments
